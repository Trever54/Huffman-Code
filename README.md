# Huffman-Code
Fall 2015

This program was written for my Programming Pragmatics class at MSU Denver. It uses Huffman Code to encode and decode a given message. The design of this program was created by Dr. Jody Paul and implemented by myself. The program was written using Test Driven Development. Examples of tests for each class besides BinaryTree.java are also included in this repository.
